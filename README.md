# Dementia_Detection

## Description
This project analyzes writing samples over a span of decades for markers of linguistic decline commonly present in cases of dementia.

This project draws from the paper 
["Longitudinal Detection of Dementia Through Lexical and Syntactic Changes in Writing" (Le, Xuan)](ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/Le-MSc-2010.pdf). The three metrics that the paper found to have produced statistically significant results—type/token ratio, word type introduction rate, and word repetition percent—are implemented in this program.

The program will return a text file (.txt) with the metrics generated and a static HTML file (.html) that displays visualizations (graphs) for data generated

### Metric Definitions
Type/token ratio: division of the types (total number of _different_ words) by lemmatized (find the stem word for variants of the same word) tokens (total number of words)


## Interpreting Results
