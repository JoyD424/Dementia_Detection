# Dementia_Detection

Goal for the project: Analyze in writing samples (from a single person) taken across a couple of decades and determine if that person exhibits signs of demetia

Where I'm at right now: Very initial stages. I've read a paper recommended by Mr. Orwant from a similar project. I need to figure out what linguistic markers my project will be looking at and then start coding it up. More generally, though, I still need to figure out how to organize my project.
